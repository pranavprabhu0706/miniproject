Hi!
Welcome to my Health Advisor project!

What does this project do?
1. This project takes user's symptoms as an input and it will prescribe the precaution, workout and the diet that the user must follow.
2. Also there is an in-built chatbot where users can enter the symptom they are facing and get the required advice.
3. If the user is new, the user can register themselves using their name, age, gender, date of birth, email, password, etc...
4. If the user has already registered, they can just login using their email and password.

Thank You!
